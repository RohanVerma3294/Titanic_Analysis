# Titanic Dataset Analysis with Seaborn

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset using the Seaborn library in Python. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket class, cabin location, fare, and survival status.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to explore the Titanic dataset visually using Seaborn to gain insights into factors influencing passenger survival rates. By visualizing relationships between various features, we aim to understand patterns in survival and identify factors that contributed to passengers' chances of survival.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this analysis includes the following features:

- **Survived**: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Deck**: Deck of the cabin (if available).
